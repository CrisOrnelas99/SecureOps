# SecureOps Lite Architecture

## Purpose

This document explains how SecureOps Lite is intended to work, how its parts fit together, and how each major feature should be implemented. It is the technical implementation guide for the project, while `Roadmap.md` remains the progress and execution tracker.

> Implementation note: this file is intentionally more detailed than `README.md`. `README.md` explains the project at a high level. This file explains how the system should actually be built.

## System Overview

SecureOps Lite is a full-stack cybersecurity application for:

- tracking assets
- importing relevant CVEs from NVD/NIST
- assigning vulnerabilities to affected assets
- calculating asset risk
- monitoring risk changes over time
- refreshing vulnerability intelligence
- raising alerts for important security events
- presenting the current security picture in a dashboard
- explaining asset security posture through an asset-aware chatbot

The system is intentionally split into clear responsibilities:

- Angular handles the browser UI
- the Go Gin/GORM backend handles authentication, validation, business logic, data orchestration, NVD integration, AI orchestration, and chat orchestration
- PostgreSQL stores application data
- focused Go services handle narrow, isolated tasks that are fast, focused, and easy to reason about

> Design comment: the backend should stay the main system boundary. Even when AI or external services are added, the main Go backend should remain the place where trust decisions, authorization checks, and persistence rules are enforced.

## High-Level Architecture

```text
Browser
  |
  v
Angular frontend
  |
  v
Go Gin/GORM API
  |
  +--> PostgreSQL
  |
  +--> risk-service
  |
  +--> alert-service-go
  |
  +--> cve-sync-service-go
  |
  +--> NVD / NIST APIs
  |
  `--> AI provider API
```

### Request flow

1. A user interacts with the Angular frontend.
2. Angular sends HTTP requests to the Go backend API.
3. The Go backend authenticates the request, validates input, and runs business logic.
4. The Go backend reads or writes data in PostgreSQL as needed.
5. For NVD import flows, the Go backend calls NVD APIs and optionally an AI-assisted matching layer.
6. For risk scoring, the Go backend sends summarized vulnerability data to `risk-service`.
7. For security events, the Go backend may notify `alert-service-go`.
8. For scheduled CVE refresh work, the Go backend coordinates with or receives updates from `cve-sync-service-go`.
9. The Go backend returns a safe response to Angular.

> Security comment: Angular should never call NVD directly, never call AI providers directly, and never call Go services directly. This keeps secrets on the server side and keeps authorization decisions centralized.

## Repository Structure

The repository should continue following the current naming style:

```text
secureops-lite/
|-- frontend-angular/
|-- backend-Go/
|-- alert-service-go/
|-- cve-sync-service-go/
|-- docker-compose.yml
|-- .env
|-- README.md
|-- Roadmap.md
`-- architecture.md
```

> Naming comment: `backend-Go/risk-service` is the current focused risk service. Future focused services such as `alert-service-go` and `cve-sync-service-go` should use the same narrow-service style.

## Project Direction

The updated project idea is:

SecureOps Lite is a cybersecurity asset risk platform that:

- stores technical asset details
- identifies likely product matches for those assets
- imports vulnerabilities from NVD/NIST
- assigns imported CVEs to assets
- calculates risk through a dedicated Go service
- uses AI to improve product matching and relevance review
- uses a chatbot to explain asset risk and vulnerability posture in plain English

> Architecture comment: the biggest shift is that vulnerabilities are no longer only manually entered data. They become intelligence-backed records that can be imported, refreshed, prioritized, explained, and monitored.

## Frontend Architecture

### Responsibilities

The Angular frontend should be responsible for:

- login and registration screens
- route navigation
- dashboard rendering
- asset management screens
- vulnerability management screens
- asset detail view
- NVD import actions
- alert and risk views
- chatbot UI for asset-level questions
- calling backend APIs through Angular services
- attaching JWTs to protected requests

### Recommended structure

The frontend should stay feature-based and simple:

```text
frontend-angular/
|-- src/app/
|   |-- core/
|   |   |-- services/
|   |   |-- guards/
|   |   `-- interceptors/
|   |-- features/
|   |   |-- auth/
|   |   |-- dashboard/
|   |   |-- assets/
|   |   |-- vulnerabilities/
|   |   |-- alerts/
|   |   `-- chat/
|   |-- shared/
|   |   |-- models/
|   |   `-- components/
|   `-- app.routes.ts
```

### Frontend implementation details

#### Authentication

- `register` and `login` forms should post to the backend auth endpoints
- JWT handling should be centralized in an auth service
- an HTTP interceptor should attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on protected requests
- route guards should prevent unauthenticated access to private pages
- logout should clear local auth state and redirect to login

> Security comment: frontend route guards improve user flow, but they do not enforce real security. Backend authorization still decides what a user can access.

#### Assets

Assets should now be treated as both business objects and product fingerprints.

The asset UI should support:

- asset name
- asset type
- vendor
- product
- version
- operating system
- owner
- criticality
- exposure-related flags if added later

> Implementation note: `asset name` is usually an internal label like `Firewall-01`. That is not enough for CVE matching. `vendor`, `product`, and `version` are the fields that make NVD integration realistic.

#### Asset details

The asset detail page should become the main workflow page for:

- viewing assigned vulnerabilities
- seeing risk score and risk level
- running `Find Vulnerabilities from NVD`
- reviewing NVD match confidence
- recalculating risk
- reading risk explanations
- chatting about the asset

#### Vulnerabilities

- vulnerability list page should support severity and status filtering
- imported NVD vulnerabilities should be visually distinguishable from manually created records
- the UI should show source metadata such as `NVD`, `cvssScore`, `publishedAt`, and last sync time where useful

#### Dashboard

The dashboard should eventually show:

- total assets
- total vulnerabilities
- open vulnerabilities
- critical vulnerabilities
- high-risk assets
- recent alert events
- recent NVD sync activity
- risk trend highlights

## Backend Architecture

### Responsibilities

The Go Gin/GORM backend is the trust boundary and main orchestration layer. It should handle:

- registration and login
- password hashing
- JWT generation and validation
- access control
- request validation
- asset CRUD
- vulnerability CRUD
- asset-vulnerability assignment
- NVD integration
- AI-assisted product and CVE relevance support
- chatbot orchestration
- risk service integration
- alert service integration
- sync job coordination
- safe error handling
- CORS policy
- WAF-style request filtering
- audit-relevant event logging

### Recommended package layout

The project should stay separated by layer and concern:

```text
backend-Go/
|-- main/
|   |-- main.go
|   `-- api/
|       |-- config/
|       |-- controller/
|       |   |-- asset_controller.go
|       |   |-- auth_controller.go
|       |   |-- service_interfaces.go
|       |   `-- vulnerability_controller.go
|       |-- database/
|       |-- middleware/
|       |-- model/
|       |   |-- asset.go
|       |   |-- asset_dto.go
|       |   |-- auth_dto.go
|       |   |-- risk_dto.go
|       |   `-- vulnerability_dto.go
|       |-- repository/
|       |-- response/
|       |-- security/
|       `-- service/
|           |-- asset_service.go
|           |-- repository_error_mapping.go
|           |-- repository_interfaces.go
|           `-- service_errors.go
`-- risk-service/
    |-- main.go
    `-- api/
        |-- config/
        |-- controller/
        |-- model/
        |-- response/
        `-- service/
```

> Design comment: `nvd`, `ai`, and `chat` belong in the main Go backend because they depend on authorization, database rules, DTO mapping, and application-level trust decisions. They should not be pushed into separate services just because they talk to external services.

### Backend layer rules

The main Go backend should keep this dependency direction:

```text
controller -> service -> repository -> database
```

Layer responsibilities:

- `controller`: HTTP-only concerns such as Gin context handling, JSON binding, route parameter parsing, and response calls
- `service`: business validation, risk orchestration, repository-error translation, and use-case coordination
- `repository`: GORM/database reads and writes only
- `database`: connection, schema setup, and database lifecycle
- `response`: HTTP status mapping and safe response messages
- `middleware`: request filtering and Gin middleware behavior
- `security`: JWT generation, parsing, and authentication filtering
- `config`: environment-backed construction of config and dependencies

Interfaces should be owned by the consuming layer:

- `controller/service_interfaces.go` defines the service interfaces controllers need
- `service/repository_interfaces.go` defines the repository interfaces services need
- repository structs satisfy those interfaces implicitly
- service structs satisfy controller interfaces implicitly

This keeps controllers unaware of repository implementations and keeps repositories unaware of HTTP.

### DTO and model placement

The current code keeps database/domain structs and request/response DTO structs in `api/model`:

- database/domain structs: `asset.go`, `user.go`, `vulnerability.go`, `waf_event.go`
- DTO structs: `asset_dto.go`, `auth_dto.go`, `risk_dto.go`, `vulnerability_dto.go`

DTO files should not live in `controller`. Controllers use DTOs, but DTOs are not controller behavior. A future cleanup may split DTOs into an `api/dto` package, but the current `model/*_dto.go` layout is acceptable as long as controller and service code do not depend on controller-owned DTO types.

### Error handling layout

Package-level `errors.go` files should stay simple:

```go
type ServiceError struct {
	Message string
}

func (e ServiceError) Error() string {
	return e.Message
}

var (
	ErrInvalidRequestData = &ServiceError{Message: "invalid request data"}
)
```

Rules:

- `errors.go` files contain only the error struct, its `Error()` method, and sentinel vars
- repository errors describe repository/database outcomes only
- service errors are more general business outcomes such as invalid request, conflict, not found, invalid credentials, remote service error, remote rejection, and invalid remote result
- middleware and security errors follow the same simple sentinel style
- helper functions and mapping logic belong in normal implementation files, not in `errors.go`
- config does not need `config_errors.go` until config loading returns `(Config, error)`

### Core backend flows

#### Register flow

1. Client sends registration data to `POST /api/auth/register`.
2. Backend validates required fields and uniqueness rules.
3. Password is hashed with BCrypt.
4. User is saved in PostgreSQL.
5. Backend returns a safe success response without sensitive fields.

#### Login flow

1. Client sends credentials to `POST /api/auth/login`.
2. Backend loads the user by username or email.
3. BCrypt verifies the password.
4. Backend generates a JWT if credentials are valid.
5. Backend returns a login response DTO with token metadata.

#### Protected request flow

1. Angular sends a request with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
2. JWT filter extracts the token.
3. Backend validates the token.
4. Gin authentication middleware establishes the authenticated request context.
5. Controller logic runs only if access is allowed.

#### Asset creation flow

1. User creates an asset.
2. Backend validates asset fields.
3. Backend stores the asset in PostgreSQL.
4. Asset is available for later NVD import and risk work.

> Implementation note: asset creation and NVD import should be separate at first. That keeps the create flow fast and avoids coupling user data entry to external API latency.

#### NVD import flow

This should follow Option B:

1. User creates the asset first.
2. User clicks `Find Vulnerabilities from NVD`.
3. The Go backend loads the asset.
4. The Go backend builds a product fingerprint from `vendor`, `product`, `version`, and related metadata.
5. The Go backend searches NVD CPE data.
6. AI may help rank candidate matches when there is ambiguity.
7. The Go backend selects or confirms the best CPE.
8. The Go backend queries NVD CVEs using that selected CPE.
9. The Go backend maps the returned CVE data to local vulnerability records.
10. The Go backend assigns those vulnerabilities to the asset.
11. The Go backend triggers risk recalculation.

> Security comment: the NVD API is the vulnerability source of truth. AI may help rank or explain relevance, but AI should not invent vulnerabilities or silently override official data.

#### Asset chat flow

1. User opens an asset detail page.
2. User asks a chat question.
3. Angular sends the question to `POST /api/assets/{id}/chat`.
4. The Go backend verifies the user is allowed to view that asset.
5. The Go backend loads only the relevant asset context.
6. The Go backend builds a constrained prompt from local data plus stored NVD metadata.
7. The Go backend calls the AI provider.
8. The Go backend returns a read-only natural-language response.

> Security comment: the chatbot should explain and summarize. It should not directly mutate assets, vulnerabilities, assignments, or risk scores.

## NVD / NIST Integration Design

### Why this belongs in the Go backend

NVD integration is mostly:

- HTTP integration
- DTO mapping
- validation
- persistence
- deduplication
- asset-to-product matching
- authorization-aware business logic

Those are already main-backend responsibilities.

### Asset fingerprinting

For reliable matching, an asset should include:

- `name`
- `type`
- `vendor`
- `product`
- `version`
- `operatingSystem`
- optional deployment notes or environment tags

> Concept comment: `Firewall-01` is a useful asset label, but it is not a vulnerability lookup key. NVD matching works much better when the app knows what product and version the asset actually runs.

### Recommended stored fields

On `Asset`, plan for fields like:

- `vendor`
- `product`
- `version`
- `cpeName`
- `cpeMatchConfidence`
- `cpeMatchMethod`
- `lastNvdSyncAt`

### Local vulnerability storage

NVD results should be stored locally in PostgreSQL.

Benefits:

- faster UI reads
- stable dashboard data
- historical comparison
- less rate-limit pressure
- easier relevance review
- easier risk recalculation

> Security comment: do not live-query NVD every time a page loads. That would be slow, noisy, harder to secure, and more likely to create inconsistent user-facing results.

## AI-Assisted Matching Design

### Role of AI

AI should be a supporting layer, not the truth layer.

AI can help:

- normalize vendor and product names
- rank likely CPE matches
- explain why a given CPE seems relevant
- rank CVEs by likely relevance to the asset
- explain risk in plain English

AI should not:

- invent CVEs
- replace NVD as source of truth
- bypass authorization
- silently auto-import weak matches with no confidence threshold

### Recommended pattern

1. deterministically query candidate CPEs from NVD
2. give the AI only the asset details and candidate options
3. ask the AI to rank the candidates and explain confidence
4. if confidence is high, continue
5. if confidence is low, require user confirmation

> Security comment: this is the safe way to use AI in a security tool. The model helps interpret ambiguity, but deterministic systems still control data integrity.

## Chatbot Design

### Purpose

The chatbot should answer asset-specific questions such as:

- what vulnerabilities affect this asset
- why this asset is high or critical risk
- which CVEs should be prioritized
- what changed after a sync or recalculation
- why a vulnerability was imported
- what the risk score means in plain English

### Scope

The first version should be asset-scoped, not global.

Recommended endpoint:

- `POST /api/assets/{id}/chat`

### Grounding strategy

The chatbot should answer using:

- asset data from PostgreSQL
- assigned vulnerability data
- stored NVD metadata
- risk score and risk level
- alert summaries if useful
- sync history if useful

It should not depend on live internet lookups for every answer.

> Security comment: grounded answers are safer than open-ended chat because the model is less likely to hallucinate when it is anchored to local records.

### Chat security rules

- require authentication
- require asset-level authorization
- rate limit chat requests
- limit prompt size
- sanitize user-provided text before prompt construction where needed
- never include secrets, tokens, or hidden internal config in prompts
- treat model output as untrusted text
- render chat output safely in Angular

## Go Services Architecture

Go should remain focused on narrow services that are easy to reason about and easy to secure.

### 1. `risk-service`

Purpose:

- calculate asset risk score from summarized vulnerability data

Why it exists:

- keeps scoring logic isolated
- provides a clear service-to-service boundary
- makes the algorithm easy to test independently

### 2. `alert-service-go`

Purpose:

- detect and process important security events

Examples:

- new critical CVE imported for an asset
- risk score crosses a threshold
- repeated NVD sync failures
- asset becomes newly critical

Possible outputs:

- create alert records
- return event severity
- later send notifications or webhook events

> Design comment: this service should stay focused on alert evaluation and alert generation. It should not become a general-purpose workflow engine.

### 3. `cve-sync-service-go`

Purpose:

- refresh previously imported CVE data on a schedule or on demand

Examples:

- sync modified CVE metadata
- refresh CVSS values
- detect changed NVD records
- update asset vulnerability freshness state

> Implementation note: this service does not replace the main Go backend as the owner of NVD import business rules. It supports refresh and synchronization work. The main Go backend still owns the core application workflow and persistence decisions.

### Why not move NVD or chatbot into Go

Those responsibilities depend heavily on:

- authorization
- DTO control
- asset ownership rules
- database writes
- trust-boundary decisions
- prompt safety

That makes the main Go backend the better home for them.

## Data Design

### Main tables

- `users`
- `assets`
- `vulnerabilities`
- `asset_vulnerabilities`
- `alerts`
- optional `chat_sessions`
- optional `chat_messages`
- optional `waf_events`
- optional sync history tables

### Relationships

- one user can create many assets
- one asset can have many vulnerabilities
- one vulnerability can be assigned to many assets
- one asset can produce many alerts
- one asset can have many chat messages if chat persistence is enabled

### Asset shape

An asset should include fields such as:

- `id`
- `name`
- `type`
- `vendor`
- `product`
- `version`
- `ipAddress`
- `operatingSystem`
- `owner`
- `criticality`
- `riskScore`
- `riskLevel`
- `cpeName`
- `cpeMatchConfidence`
- `cpeMatchMethod`
- `lastNvdSyncAt`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

### Vulnerability shape

A vulnerability should include fields such as:

- `id`
- `cveId`
- `title`
- `severity`
- `description`
- `status`
- `source`
- `sourceReference`
- `cvssScore`
- `cvssVector`
- `publishedAt`
- `lastModifiedAt`
- `nvdStatus`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

### Asset-vulnerability assignment shape

The join record can eventually hold useful metadata such as:

- `relevanceConfidence`
- `relevanceReason`
- `matchMethod`
- `importedFromNvdAt`
- `lastVerifiedAt`
- `isManuallyReviewed`

> Design comment: this metadata matters because it separates “this CVE exists in NVD” from “this CVE is relevant to this specific asset.”

### Alert shape

An alert can include:

- `id`
- `assetId`
- `type`
- `severity`
- `message`
- `status`
- `source`
- `createdAt`
- `acknowledgedAt`

## API Design

### Authentication endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`

### Asset endpoints

- `GET /api/assets`
- `GET /api/assets/{id}`
- `POST /api/assets`
- `PUT /api/assets/{id}`
- `DELETE /api/assets/{id}`
- `POST /api/assets/{id}/import-nvd-vulnerabilities`
- `POST /api/assets/{id}/calculate-risk`
- `GET /api/assets/{id}/alerts`
- `POST /api/assets/{id}/chat`
- `POST /api/assets/{assetId}/vulnerabilities/{vulnerabilityId}`
- `DELETE /api/assets/{assetId}/vulnerabilities/{vulnerabilityId}`

### Vulnerability endpoints

- `GET /api/vulnerabilities`
- `GET /api/vulnerabilities/{id}`
- `POST /api/vulnerabilities`
- `PUT /api/vulnerabilities/{id}`
- `DELETE /api/vulnerabilities/{id}`

### Sync and alert endpoints

- `POST /api/sync/nvd`
- `GET /api/alerts`
- `PATCH /api/alerts/{id}/acknowledge`

> Implementation note: the sync endpoint should eventually be admin-protected. Background scheduled sync is safer than exposing too much operational control to normal users.

### Response shape rules

- never return password hashes
- use DTOs for request and response payloads
- keep auth errors generic
- keep validation errors readable but not overly revealing
- return safe `404`, `400`, `401`, and `403` responses where appropriate
- do not leak raw upstream stack traces or provider secrets
- map service errors to HTTP responses in the response layer, not in repositories

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and authorization

- passwords should be hashed with BCrypt
- backend routes should be protected with Gin JWT middleware
- authorization checks must be enforced on the backend for all asset, chat, sync, and alert operations
- admin-only or elevated routes should be explicitly separated from normal user routes

### Input validation

- validate request DTOs in the backend service layer
- allowlist structured values like severity, status, criticality, and alert types
- validate IDs and ownership assumptions before changing records
- validate all imported upstream data before trusting it

### NVD and external API security

- keep the NVD API key in environment variables
- do not expose the NVD key to Angular
- cache and store imported results locally
- respect rate limits
- handle upstream failures safely and generically

### AI security

- keep model API keys server-side only
- never allow the model to access unrestricted internal data
- constrain prompts to asset-specific context
- defend against prompt injection and data exfiltration attempts
- treat model output as advisory text, not executable truth

### WAF-style filtering

The lightweight WAF filter is meant to block obviously suspicious input patterns early, such as:

- SQL injection-like strings
- XSS-like strings
- path traversal patterns like `../`

This should be treated as an extra defensive layer, not a replacement for normal validation and safe coding.

### Secrets and config

- keep `.env` out of source control
- treat `.env` as local development only
- avoid hardcoded JWT secrets, DB passwords, and service URLs
- prefer environment-based configuration for backend services
- avoid baking secrets into container images

### Logging rules

- log blocked suspicious requests carefully
- log authentication and security-relevant events when useful
- never log plaintext passwords
- never log full JWTs or secret values
- avoid leaking stack traces to API consumers
- keep AI prompt and response logging minimal and sanitized if stored

## Docker and Environment Design

### Compose responsibilities

`docker-compose.yml` should eventually orchestrate:

- PostgreSQL
- Go Gin/GORM backend
- Angular frontend
- `risk-service`
- `alert-service-go`
- `cve-sync-service-go`

### Networking rules

- Angular should call the Go backend
- the Go backend should call PostgreSQL and Go services by service name inside Docker
- the Go backend should call external APIs over outbound network access
- Angular should never call NVD directly
- Angular should never call AI providers directly
- Angular should never call Go services directly

### Environment variables

Typical values should include:

- database host
- database port
- database name
- database username
- database password
- JWT secret
- JWT expiration
- NVD API key
- AI provider API key
- risk service base URL
- alert service base URL
- cve sync service base URL
- frontend API base URL

## Implementation Order

The intended build order is:

1. finish the current frontend auth and basic styling work
2. expand the asset model for product-aware matching
3. add Go backend NVD integration
4. add manual `Find Vulnerabilities from NVD`
5. store imported CVEs locally and assign them to assets
6. reuse `risk-service` to recalculate risk
7. add AI-assisted CPE ranking and CVE relevance review
8. add `alert-service-go`
9. add `cve-sync-service-go`
10. add the asset-scoped chatbot
11. add dashboard support for alerts, sync, and risk trends
12. do Docker integration across all services
13. do hardening, access review, and end-to-end testing

`Roadmap.md` should remain the canonical checklist for what is done and what is next.

## Current Status Summary

Based on the current project plan, the backend foundation is in place through Go backend to Go risk-service integration. The next major implementation area is still the Angular frontend, but the longer-term project direction now includes NVD-backed vulnerability import, AI-assisted matching, an asset-scoped chatbot, an alerting service, and a CVE refresh service.

## Future Improvements

Possible later improvements include:

- role-based access control
- managed database migrations with Flyway or Liquibase
- stronger audit logging
- pagination and server-side filtering
- remediation prioritization
- exposure scoring
- better dashboard analytics
- secure secret management beyond local `.env`
- automated tests across frontend, backend, and Go services
- container hardening and production deployment guidance
