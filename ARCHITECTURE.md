# SecureOps Architecture

## Purpose

This document describes the current technical architecture of SecureOps.
Use it with `README.md`, `CLEANCODE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `Roadmap.md`.

## System Overview

SecureOps is a cybersecurity asset-risk platform built around:

- Angular frontend
- Go Gin/GORM backend
- PostgreSQL persistence
- NVD / NIST vulnerability data
- AI-assisted asset ingestion planned behind the backend
- focused Go services for limited background tasks
- HTTPS/TLS termination at the deployment boundary with server-side certificate handling
- future AWS deployment can host the backend, database, certificates, logging, and scheduled jobs through managed services

The backend is the trust boundary. Angular never talks directly to NVD, AI providers, or internal services.

## Current Runtime Shape

- Frontend: Angular application
- API: Go backend in `backend-Go/`
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Local orchestration: Docker Compose
- Secure deployments should terminate TLS in a reverse proxy or in the Go backend, but certificates stay server-side
- AWS is a later deployment layer, not a replacement for the backend trust boundary

## Backend Responsibilities

The Go backend owns:

- authentication
- access-token generation
- refresh-token rotation and session revocation
- authorization and permission checks
- asset CRUD
- vulnerability CRUD
- asset-to-vulnerability assignment
- NVD lookup and local vulnerability persistence
- structured request logging and security logging
- safe error handling and input validation
- cloud deployment compatibility for managed services such as ECR, ECS/Fargate, RDS, ALB/ACM, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, and EventBridge

## Auth Model

The current auth model uses short-lived JWT access tokens and server-side refresh-token sessions.

Important notes:

- access tokens are short-lived
- refresh tokens are stored and validated server-side through the refresh-session table
- logout revokes the stored session
- protected requests check both the access token and the active session state
- login resolves `userOrEmail` by shape: email-like values use email lookup, everything else uses username lookup
- outbound TLS verification remains enabled for external API calls such as NVD

### Flow Summary

1. Client posts credentials to `POST /api/auth/login`.
2. Backend verifies the password.
3. Backend issues an access token and refresh token pair.
4. Backend stores the refresh session in PostgreSQL.
5. Protected requests use `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`.
6. Refresh requests use `POST /api/auth/refresh` with the refresh token in the body.
7. Logout uses `POST /api/auth/logout` with the refresh token in the body.

> Note: access-token and refresh-token character length is an implementation detail, not a security property. In this codebase both are JWTs, so length should not be used as a design rule.

## Data Model

Core current entities:

- users
- assets
- vulnerabilities
- asset_vulnerabilities
- refresh_sessions

Assets and vulnerabilities are user-owned in the current implementation.

## API Surface

Implemented auth routes:

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`

Implemented asset routes:

- `GET /api/assets`
- `GET /api/assets/{id}`
- `POST /api/assets`
- `PUT /api/assets/{id}`
- `DELETE /api/assets/{id}`

Implemented vulnerability routes:

- `GET /api/vulnerabilities`
- `GET /api/vulnerabilities/{id}`
- `POST /api/vulnerabilities`
- `PUT /api/vulnerabilities/{id}`
- `DELETE /api/vulnerabilities/{id}`

Implemented assignment routes:

- `POST /api/assets/{assetId}/vulnerabilities/{vulnerabilityId}`
- `POST /api/assets/{assetId}/vulnerabilities/cve/{cveId}`
- `DELETE /api/assets/{assetId}/vulnerabilities/{vulnerabilityId}`

Implemented NVD route:

- `GET /api/nvd/cves/{cveId}`

## NVD / Vulnerability Handling

NVD integration lives in the backend because it needs:

- HTTP access
- request validation
- DTO mapping
- safe persistence
- authorization-aware business logic

NVD results are stored locally instead of live-querying the browser repeatedly.

## Code Structure

The backend follows:

```text
controller -> service -> repository -> database
```

Package roles:

- `controller`: HTTP binding and responses
- `service`: business rules and orchestration
- `repository`: persistence
- `model`: database/domain structs
- `dto`: request and response shapes
- `middleware`: request auth and guards
- `security`: JWT and token helpers
- `utils`: database and identifier helpers

## Environment

Typical local variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `JWT_EXPIRATION_MS`
- `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_MS`
- `POSTGRES_DB`
- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PORT`
- `NVD_API_KEY`
- `BOOTSTRAP_DEV_DATA`

## Security Notes

See `SECURITY.md` for the full policy.

Key current rules:

- do not trust browser-side authorization
- do not expose secrets to the frontend
- use backend validation and authorization
- keep NVD and AI calls server-side
- store imported vulnerability data locally
